;; TIPS

;; (1) `C-l'
;; C-l calls the `recenter-top-bottom' command. But typing C-l twice in a row
;; (C-l C-l) scrolls the window so that point is on the topmost screen line.
;; Typing a third C-l scrolls the window so that point is on the bottom-most
;; screen line. Each successive C-l cycles through these three positions.
